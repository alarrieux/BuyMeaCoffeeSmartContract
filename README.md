# Ashley's Coffee Shop

The code represents a simple contract that allows a user to buy a cup of coffee for the owner of the contract. The buyer can provide his or her name and leave a message. The contract itself is deployed on the ethereum test network, Rinkeby, but adjusting the harhatconfig you can call the network you want the contract to be deployed on.
